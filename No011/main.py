# Good morning. Here's your coding interview problem for today.
# This problem was asked by Twitter.
#
# Implement an autocomplete system. That is, given a query string
# s and a set of all possible query strings, return all strings
# in the set that have s as a prefix.
#
# For example, given the query string de and the set of strings
# [dog, deer, deal], return [deer, deal].
#
# Hint: Try preprocessing the dictionary into a more efficient data
# structure to speed up queries.
