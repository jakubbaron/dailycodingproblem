# Good morning. Here's your coding interview problem for today.
# This problem was asked by Airbnb.
#
# Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the
# largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.
#
# For example, [2, 4, 6, 8] should return 12, since we pick 4 and 8.
# [5, 1, 1, 5] should return 10, since we pick 5 and 5.
#
# Follow-up: Can you do this in O(N) time and constant space?

  pass
def main():
  arr = [2, 4, 6 ,8]

  arr = [5, 1, 1, 5]

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
