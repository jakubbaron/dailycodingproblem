# Good morning. Here's your coding interview problem for today.
# This problem was asked by Amazon.
#
# Given an integer k and a string s, find the length of the longest
# substring that contains at most k distinct characters.
#
# For example, given s = "abcba" and k = 2, the longest substring
# with k distinct characters is "bcb".
